              <b>1903 : </b>Studied the contents of the book, A Synopsis of

              Ramanujan's formulae but others "seemed scarcely possible to
              believe". Hardy wrote a letter to Ramanujan, expressing his
              interest for his work. Hardy contacted the Indian Office to plan
              for Ramanujan's trip to Cambridge. Ramanujan refused to leave his
              country to "go to a foreign land".

              which the family Goddess commanded her "to stand no longer between
              her son and the fulfilment of his life's purpose". Ramanujan then
              set sail for England.
